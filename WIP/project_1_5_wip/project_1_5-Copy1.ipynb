    "Write 1 and only 1 query.  Note that the query may have as many subqueries, including \"with\" clauses, as you wish.  Any query of your choosing.  You can write a query from scratch.  You can use a query from a previous problem in this project.  You can use a query from the labs.  The idea is to come up with a query whose resulting data will make for an excellent quality data visualization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that when you check this Juptyer Notebook into GitHub that the query results in the Pandas dataframe are clearly visible in GitHub.  Note: When a query result has a large number of rows, Pandas will only display the first 5 rows, a row with ellipses, and the last 5 rows. This is ok.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have the data in a Pandas dataframe, you may write as much Python code and use as many code cells as you wish to produce the data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may only use Python modules that are currently installed in the Anaconda Docker container.  You may not install additional modules or any other software.\n",
    "\n",
    "All work must be done in Docker in your VM in AWS.  You may not use any external data visualization systems, such as Tableau, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may use any code from the labs to pattern your code after, however for the data visualization, you cannot wholesale copy a data visualization from the labs.\n",

    "If you want to use Google Maps for your data visualization, this is fine, however, the image will not show up in GitHub.  So, just save the image to an image file, include it in the repo, and add a markdown cell to display the image file. Also with Google Maps, do NOT check gmap_api_key.txt into GitHub for security reasons.  If the grader needs to run it, they will supply their own gmap_api_key.txt.\n"
